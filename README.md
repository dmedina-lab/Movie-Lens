# Movie-Lens
For this Project we will create a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset (10M version).  
The first step will be download and generate the dataset, split in two subsets, an edx set for training and test and a validation set for evaluate the final algorithm, with a relation 90% y 10% of DataLens dataset respectively.   
The second step will be explore the dataset, develop and train a machine learning algorithm using the inputs in one subset of edx set to predict movie ratings. We will train different models and will evaluate the performance in the test set.   
The final model will be compared to the true ratings in the validation set using RMSE(residual mean squared error) to evaluate how close our predictions are.
